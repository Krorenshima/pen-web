Here's the documents path, this will show you some documented,
tutorials. All made by me.

Note that this is only managed by one person, so please mind that there's barely any tutorials.

## Kickstart

So pen, is a small or large or whatever you want to call it. Module, Framework, API or whatnot.
It's used for most common tasks that would be rather annoying to write over and over again.

Instead of just the general vanilla js, for making elements and manipulating them.
Pen passes out an object, that is close to being an element, it gives out information on the element itself.
Such as a selector, it doesn't give a *full* selector it just gives the general TAG#ID.CLASS(ES) -- if multiple

It takes a bit more to understand but I'll hand the general gist, <penElement>.el stands for element
and it just passes the element that was created or grabbed from the document/webpage.
.cel stands for nothing really it may be changed to .sel which would stand for "smart-element"
which essentially grabs the real element and not the outer layer.

.Classes is an array that just holds it's classes.

.attrs stands for attributes which is just an attribute information storage.

.size is just the size of the element itself.

.selector is what I explained already.

.hidden is a way to tell if the element is hidden or not

and that's it for the object, now there's the methods that handle manipulation which will be links

[.html()](.html.md)
[.css()](.css.md)
